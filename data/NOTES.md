## USC-SIPI Image Database
The USC-SIPI image database is a collection of digitized images. 
It is maintained primarily to support research in image processing, 
image analysis, and machine vision. The first edition of the 
USC-SIPI image database was distributed in 1977 and many new 
images have been added since then.
